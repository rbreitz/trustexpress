AliExpress has a known issue in which practically all reviews will give a product 5/5 stars regardless of whether they enjoyed it. It is therefore necessary to read through the reviews to figure out whether you can trust a product -- but this is often very painful, with many reviews being poorly translated from other languages and others being repetitive or unhelpful. TrustExpress built a helpfulness predictor on Amazon reviews and applied it to AliExpress reviews so that its website could show the most helpful reviews of a product to a user at a glance.
Natural Language Processing and a Logistic Regression were used in making the helpfulness predictor, which performed with a precision of 91% within the Amazon reviews.
